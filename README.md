Main Topic: Jump Recording with IMU on a Kiteboard Using LoRaWAN & E-Paper Display
Objective:
To record and display jump data (height, airtime, and impact acceleration) on an E-paper display attached to a kiteboard. The data, along with GPS coordinates, will also be sent via LoRaWAN for remote tracking and retrieval.

System Components:
ESP32 (LoRaWAN-enabled) – To handle processing, communication, and connectivity.

IMU (MPU6886 or similar) – To capture acceleration, orientation, and angular velocity for jump data.

GPS Module – To track the real-time location of the kiteboard.

LoRaWAN Module – To transmit data over long distances (e.g., via a LoRa gateway to a cloud server).

E-paper Display – For displaying real-time data on the kiteboard in outdoor conditions.....NO REFLECTIONS SUNLIGHT!!!

Battery – For powering the system.

How It Works:
IMU Data for Jump Recording:

The IMU detects changes in acceleration and orientation when the kiteboard is in motion.

During a jump, the IMU records:

Takeoff acceleration: When the board leaves the ground.

Airtime: The time spent in the air (derived from the IMU's acceleration data).

Impact acceleration: When landing, showing the impact force on the board.

Jump height: Calculated based on the airtime and vertical acceleration.

GPS for Real-Time Location:   ALSO FOR FIND MY KITEBOARD !!!!!  😁😁   

The GPS module continuously records the latitude and longitude of the kiteboard.

GPS data is used to show the location of the board on the E-paper display.

LoRaWAN for Data Transmission:

Once a jump is detected and the session is complete, the jump data (height, airtime, impact acceleration) and GPS coordinates are sent via LoRaWAN to a remote station or cloud server for storage and tracking.

This data can be retrieved later for analysis or real-time monitoring.

E-paper Display:    LOW POWER CONSUME NO REFLECTIONS SUNLIGHT !!!😎

The E-paper display shows:

Jump height (cm) – The maximum height reached during the jump.

Airtime (s) – The duration of the jump.

Impact acceleration (g) – The force experienced upon landing.

Location (GPS coordinates) – The current position of the kiteboard.

The display updates dynamically after each jump, providing live performance data while the user is on the water.

- BMP388 + IMU (MPU6886 or BMX160) is arguably the best combo for kitesurf jump tracking. You get high-accuracy jump height, real-time airtime, and trick detection — all in a lightweight, wearable setup.
- Detect Takeoff using IMU:

Spike in upward Z-acceleration → takeoff timestamp.

Start recording altitude with BMP388:

Continue until Z-acceleration spike again (landing).

Record peak altitude:

BMP388 gives you height above takeoff point.

Calculate Airtime:

Difference between takeoff and landing timestamps.

Optional: Use gyroscope/magnetometer to detect rotations or spins.

1. BMP388 or BMP390 + BMX160 (IMU)
What you get: Jump height, airtime, 3D orientation

Why it’s great: Fast, lightweight, and super accurate

Use case: Action sports, wearables

🔹 2. BMX160 + BMP390 + GPS (like u-blox NEO-M9N)
GPS adds:

Horizontal speed

Jump distance

Position logging (spots, sessions)

Optionally: sync with GoPro footage

BMP390 is slightly more stable and accurate than BMP388.

🧠 Fusion of IMU + GPS velocity + BMP altitude = extremely solid jump profiles.

🔹 3. Add UWB (Ultra-Wideband) or Time-of-Flight (ToF)
If you're looking for elite-level precision — like <10 cm vertical tracking and real-time feedback — consider:

UWB (e.g. DWM1001):

Can give precise 3D positioning in a defined area (you’d need base stations on the beach or boat).

Works great in competitions or training environments.

ToF Sensors (e.g. VL53L1X):

Short range (up to ~4m), but instant vertical distance to water.

Useful if mounted on the board or waist
